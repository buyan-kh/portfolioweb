3. Analysis of Key GitHub Projects (Excluding Forks)


This section provides a detailed examination of Buyan Khurelbaatar's most significant and complex projects, including their URLs, descriptions, and tech stacks. Due to data limitations, the focus is primarily on his pinned repositories.


3.1. Note on Project Selection and Data Accessibility


Buyan Khurelbaatar's GitHub profile indicates a total of 56 repositories.1 However, attempts to access a comprehensive list of all these repositories with detailed information, including explicit fork status, were unsuccessful, as several relevant URLs were inaccessible.3 While general GitHub API methods 9 and CLI tools 12 exist for listing repositories and their fork status, direct access to the specific API endpoint for Buyan's repositories was not available in the provided research material.4
This limitation means that a full, definitive exclusion of all forks from the total 56 repositories is not possible with the available data. Consequently, this report focuses on the pinned repositories displayed on his main GitHub profile.1 Pinned repositories are typically selected by the user to represent their most significant, original, or actively maintained work. While a pinned repository could technically be a fork, it is generally understood to be a project to which the user has made substantial contributions or considers a core part of their portfolio. No explicit "fork" status was indicated for these pinned repositories in the provided information. This reliance on pinned repositories implies that the reported project portfolio might be a conservative representation of Buyan's actual breadth and depth of work, potentially understating his full capabilities. This data gap means the report provides a strong qualitative assessment of Buyan's showcased work, but it cannot definitively quantify the full extent of his contributions or confirm the non-fork status of all 56 repositories.
